*Which do you think is a better framework for E2E testing of web applications or web services:  Robot Framework or Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit?*
<br/>
```
For me, Robot Framework is better. The syntax and the way to use is not hard to understand. 
The framework is less complex compare to Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit.
